Most of them are things I've done in my free time, but there might be some school projects thrown in.</div> <br><br><br>
<div class="title">My Creations</div> 
<div class="gametext">These are mini games or projects I have created in the past. Most of them are more experiences then actual games. That is to say, they're usually more story related then gameplay focused. <br> 
To keep them mysterious, there will be screenshots of a part of the game accompanied with an eerie text, that will be correlated with the plot in some way. </div> <br><br><br>

    A lone man appears outside the room. There's a smell of fresh blood in the air. He looks around, assesses the situation, and takes the room with him. <br>
    A non-lone man exits the building, leaving behind a manifold of corpses. He walks around, heading to his destination, and takes a look at the contraption <br> that encompasses the room. <br>
    The contraption reads "PROPERTY OF JEHONIMUS" with the rest of the text scraped off. There's a note attached to the device, but the man puts it off for now.<br>
    A man enters his restaurant, lighting it up for the day. He puts the contraption in one of his drawers, and gets ready for work.<br>
    After all, this man is but a tea shop owner. Nothing more, nothing less."

<div class="title">Nebula</div>
<div class="gametext">Nebula was a school project I had to make a 2d arcade game using block programming.<br>
It consists of 3 levels and is a platformer.<br>
The plot is that you are an astronaut scavenging an unknown planet, when suddenly your under attack by cosmic forces, most menacingly the gigantic eye in the background.<br>
Not a very good situation! You have to find the teleporter in your space ship to bring you back to your home planet and escape.<br>
Originally, the plot was going to be about a sudden blackhole forming and enveloping the planet, but having an entirely black background wasnt good<br>
to show you the character's design or animation. Ergo, this was scrapped. <br>
Below can you see screenshots of the first and final level of the game. The final level was meant to be more of a climbing expedition, with very low gravity. A bit hard to get that across, but I think it worked out.</div> <br><br><br>
