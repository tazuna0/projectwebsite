<div class="title" id="title">Pyrite Umbrage</div>
<div class="gametext" id="gametext">You are a self-employed Mine Manager. Recently, your crew has managed to find a vein so indescribably massive. <br>
What's more, you're led to believe that this vein is full of GOLD! You know, that shiny yellow stuff! Overjoyed at this information, you seek to mine out the vein as soon as possible. Riches to be had! <br>
However, things take a turn. You and your crew find out this is actually a vein of Pyrite, or more commonly known as "Fool's Gold". Worth virtually nothing! <br>
You've been foiled. Absolutely tricked by the tectonic shifts of the earth. Distraught by this newfound information, you feel a new ember arise within you. <br>
You think God can just come in here and take away your miracle like it's nothing? You're gonna fight back. Show the world what it's like to mess with you. You're going to mine out this entire Pyrite vein for all it's worth! <br>
And then... with all your newfound Pyrite. You'll buy a gold bar. Big enough to flaunt to everyone in the world, show them who's boss. They will carve your name on that gold bar, for decades to remember! <br>
As for now, your journey starts here. <br>
(PS: Your progress does not save. If you're doing this, better do it in one shot.) </div>
