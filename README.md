## Introduction

We had an interdisciplinary project to create a website with content decided up to us.

This is the result. Have a great trip!

All code without sources linked is made by myself.

## Home
The home page depicts contraptions I have made in the past. They're usually fun little projects I have done with my friends.

Sources used to make the slideshow:

## Router Task
The router task was a side project we had assigned with our main project.
This page documents how I went about it.

## Clicker Game
The clicker game was a bit of a pandemonium.
It was where most of my hours went into, and it was actually kind of fun to create.
However, the process was time-consuming, and in so, impacted my time management... which was already lackluster.
I think it turned out well in the end.

Below you can find the sources in which I used to create the clicker game:

## About Me
This page contains basic facts about myself, as a human being. Very interesting, if you're into human beings.
